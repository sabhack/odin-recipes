    <h1>Decription</h1>
    <p>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the ultimate lasagna recipe. She tested several, and finally found her ideal in a mash-up of recipes from Giuliano Bugialli and Elodia Rigante, both Italian cookbook authors.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 extra-large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella, grated</li>
        <li>16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>For the sauce, heat 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.</li>
        <li>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
